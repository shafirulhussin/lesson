    <h1>Bookmarks with ID and Links</h1>
    <p>HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.

        Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.
        
        To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.
        
        When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.</p>
